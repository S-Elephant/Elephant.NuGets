# Mathematic branches

Some general info about mathematic branches.

## Arithmetic

The most basic branch of mathematics, focusing on the fundamental operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is concerned with the manipulation of numbers to solve basic computational problems. It does not generally involve variables, unlike algebra. In essence, arithmetic provides the building blocks for other areas of mathematics.

## Algebra

Extends arithmetic by introducing variables and constants to represent unknown numbers or quantities. It also deals with equations, functions, and the rules for manipulating these mathematical objects. Algebra allows you to understand relationships between numbers and variables, and it forms the basis for more advanced mathematical studies in fields like calculus, linear algebra, and more.

## Geometry

Focuses on the properties and relationships of shapes and spaces. It uses algebra and arithmetic to solve problems related to lines, angles, surfaces, and solids.

## Calculus

Concerned with the study of change and motion, dealing with derivatives and integrals. It often requires a strong understanding of algebra and trigonometry.

## Statistics

Focuses on collecting, analysing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It often uses concepts from algebra and calculus.

## Number Theory

Investigates the properties and relationships of numbers, especially integers. It's more abstract and often doesn't involve direct computation like arithmetic.

## Combinatorics

Concerned with counting, arrangement, and combination. This area often utilizes factorials, a concept you can calculate using basic arithmetic but which has wider applications in various branches of mathematics.

## Linear Algebra

Focuses on vector spaces and linear mappings between these spaces. It's fundamental in computer graphics, engineering, physics, and more.

## Differential Equations

Focuses on functions and the derivatives thereof and the solutions to those functions. This is essential in physics, engineering, economics, etc.
