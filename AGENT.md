## Response Format

- Don't include entire files in the response unless specifically requested. Include only the important parts such as new and/or updated code and where to put that. This also applies to markdown files.
- Never include useless information such as "take a deep breath" in a response.
- Don't write tests that only pass due to a bug in the tested method or system. Write the test(s) correctly and inform about the potential bug(s) in your response.
- Never use the — character in your responses unless specifically requested.
